# Europeana Terms of Use

The Europeana.eu website is run by the Europeana Foundation and gives access to a wide range of digitised cultural heritage from across Europe and beyond. This material is provided to Europeana by a large number of contributing institutions and organisations. Europeana strives to make all resources on this website available for re-use. As part of this, all metadata (textual information on digitised cultural heritage) on the site are published without any restrictions on re-use. Most other material, such as the previews to digitised cultural heritage, is clearly labelled with rights statements that indicate if and under which conditions it can be re-used.

## Metadata

The Europeana database and all metadata available on europeana.eu are published free of restrictions, under the terms of the [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ "Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication information"). However if you re-use data published by Europeana, we encourage you to follow the [Europeana Usage Guidelines for Metadata](http://www.europeana.eu/rights/metadata-usage-guidelines/ "Click here to view the Europeana Usage Guidelines for Metadata") and to provide attribution to the data sources whenever possible.

## Previews

The previews that are shown on Europeana.eu can only be used in accordance with the rights information displayed alongside them (the badges underneath the previews). If there is no rights information displayed alongside a preview, these previews may only be used in accordance with the applicable copyright laws. However, in the latter event, please refer to the website of the data provider to find out whether other types of use are also allowed.

Europeana is not the owner of the copyrights to the metadata, the previews or the digitised cultural heritage to which these metadata or previews refer.

These data providers have ensured Europeana that the owners of these rights have agreed to the publication of their works under the applicable conditions as referred to above. However, the Europeana Foundation cannot guarantee that this is always correct. If you think that anything published on Europeana.eu infringes your rights, you may report this to Europeana by emailing [notice@europeana.eu](mailto:notice@europeana.eu?subject=Reporting%20an%20unlawful%20use%20of%20the%20service).
