# Europeana Usage Guidelines for public domain works

**Give credit where credit is due.** When you use a public domain 
work please credit the author or creator. Please also credit the 
institution (such as the archive, museum or library) that provided the 
work, as the more you credit the institution the greater the 
encouragement to put more public domain works online.

**Protect the reputation of creators and providers.** When you use
 or modify a public domain work you should not attribute the changes to 
the creator or the provider of the work. The name or logo of the creator
 or provider should not be used to endorse the modified work or any use 
of it without their consent.

**Show respect for the original work.** Please do not use the work
 in any way that is unlawful and misleading. When you modify and 
redistribute a public domain work, any changes made to the original 
should be clearly indicated. You should label the work to show you have 
changed it, so that other users know who made the changes.

**Show respect for the creator.** If the creator, or provider on 
behalf of the creator, has asked that a public domain work should not be
 changed or that it should be used in certain contexts only, then please
 respect their wishes.

**Share knowledge.** If you use a public domain work to generate 
new work or if you have additional information about it (such where it 
came from, its author, content or other possible rights holders), please
 share your knowledge. That may include tagging, annotating or 
commenting on a public domain work that is published online and sending 
back this information to the institution that holds the original object.

**Be culturally aware.** If the work includes culturally sensitive
 elements you should not change or use these in ways that might be 
derogatory to other cultures or communities.

**Support efforts to enrich the public domain.** Users of public 
domain works are asked to support the efforts of cultural and scientific
 heritage organisations to care for, preserve, digitise and make public 
domain works available. This support should include monetary 
contributions or work in kind, particularly when the work is being used 
for commercial or other for-profit purposes and the provider is a public
 or non-profit institution.

**Preserve public domain marks and notices.** Users of a public 
domain work should not remove any public domain mark or notice that has 
been applied, or provide misleading information about its copyright 
status.

**This usage guide is based on goodwill. It is not a legal contract. We ask that you respect it.**
